                History of BMU
            </h1>
            <p>
                Bonamary University was officially founded via sub-decree on Auguest 8, 2024, by its owners, Mr. SENG Bona and his wife, Madam MAM Mary, a couple with a deep love and utmost care for education. It is the first university in Cambodia named after its founders,
                with the husband (Bona) and wife (Mary) being the inspiration behind its name. Mr. SENG Bona and Madam Mary are the CEOs and Co-founders of the True VISIONS Family, a group of True VISIONS International Schools in Phnom Penh, Cambodia,
                established in 2013. Due to significant growth and strong community support, they decided to expand their educational mission to the higher education level by founding Bonamary University. Their aim is to partially participate in promoting
                the educational system in Cambodia by establishing a collaborative multinational university. Bonamary University offers opportunities for Cambodian or international students to experience international standards of education within Cambodia
                or to pursue studies, work, or residency abroad, particularly in Australia, USA, UK, China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. Additionally, BMU focuses on nurturing an entrepreneurial spirit to inspire learners to become leaders or business
                owners globally for the betterment of humankind and the planet. The ultimate goal of BMU's educational mission is to see its graduates equipped with in-depth knowledge, skills, exemplary character, and wisdom. "Knowledge, Skills, and Character
                lead to Wisdom. And Wisdom must always be accompanied by Virtue." - Bonamary University
